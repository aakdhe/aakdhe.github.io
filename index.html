<h1> This is the first page where Aakash will program everyday.</h1>

<p>
  Last year, Aakash completed Reactor Prep. However, he didn't attend the last week or so of class for health reasons, and even when given a chance to re-attend a future RP session, did not put forth 100% effort. He now has a specific timeline to finish Fulcrum by and needs to focus. However, he's gotta catch up on his RP work so that he can successfully take on the Fulcrum courseload. This is the beginning of his RP content review / practice.
